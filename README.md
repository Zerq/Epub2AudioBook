this project is kinda dead because edge-tts stopped working presumably the service is now changed so it only runs through the browser.
i could sub it out for the google equivlent which worked last time i tried but currently working on a TTS reader lets me run it live in the browser... that requires active internet access though so may re-visit this...

that or i need to dig into gettign a local tts running... idk if i could somehow make my own browser implementation that could tap into the default api and expose my own tts implemenation hmmm.. crazy idea :p 
I would rahter run thing locally... something to tinker with maybe i can get somehow extend webwindow... idk...




currently set up to use edge-tts which is basically a python library that taps into the same text-to-speehc engine though it could use any other engine like espeak, mimic3 festival etc... fairly simple the change.

the edge-tts dependancy has to be installed separatly this is made for linux primarily in its current state.... 
might make a docker image or something of it in future just so implify things not sure..
it also requires mpv since edge-tts uses it to encode the mp3 files.

Currently there is also some variability in the structure of epub files i have not accounted for i've just laizily been adjusting the code to work... i need to work on a more general solution...
I also have an idea about making a audio book format that indexes the files and book marks and keeps track of listening prograess so a readiong can be resummed later...  had some issues finding a good cross platform solution for that...

dotnet is a bit so so for cross platform development options.. .glade works.. but its just not as easy as winforms when it come to custom components.. i've tried QT but that one has even worse bindings... also tried moernforms but its not the same and no wysiwyg tool it seams... 
the electorn.net project also seams behind on donetcore version support... atleast last time i cheked so currently i am mostly looking at a webased gui though i am still experimentinmg a lot on how to best do this..


see my liteSPA project for details on that.. also got a lot better with flexbox so think i can replicate a lot of the gui features of QT/GTK...
If i cant have a easy and powerful WYSIWYG tool that works iwth customn components then i wnt html so at least have all the flexibility i want... but i do want some easy layouting options...

at any rat eit works well enough for now that i can listen to any drm free book easily...
but i do want my player if only because a lot of player are unreliable and if the computer crashes getting back to where i was would be tricky...

basically i am doing this mostly for myself but if other find it useful nice! also good way to expperiment with cross platform but mostly linux development after i fleed to linux to escape microsoft stupid malware os :P
